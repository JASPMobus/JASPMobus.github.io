I didn't think that I was going to go into programming throughout my schooling. Programming was cool and interesting, but I never quite managed to fit it into my schedule; there was some other elective that seemed more exciting, or my necessary courses conflicted with the classes that started the Computer Science track. I liked math a lot, and came into college at the University of Dallas knowing that I wanted to be a math major, that I'd want to go to grad school, and I'd want to be a professor thereafter.

Since I knew I wanted to go into academia in math, and I loved the material so much, I took every math elective I could, in addition to all of the required courses, which lead me to graduating having taken all but three of the math courses offered by the department. That, of course, ate up a lot of my credit hours that I could've used for other fields that I had some interest in. Finally, my senior year in college, I took Introduction to Computer Science, a class filled up with freshman computer science majors, and it was an incredible amount of fun. My professor mentioned to me that the logical intuition that I'd built up reading and writing proofs for years was a huge boon to programming, and I found over the course of that class and another course that I took the subsequent semester that programming came to me easily, and it was incredibly fun.

Then I graduated, with a BS in Math and a grand total of two Computer Science courses under my belt. the following summer, I thought long and hard about what I wanted to do. I distracted myself with planning my wedding and applying for jobs for the year off that I intended to take, but I didn't like leaving a problem unsolved, so I kept on coming back to my plans. I had a lot of fun with math, and grad school seemed like it was the "natural" next step, but programming felt more energizing, and I certainly didn't know enough of that to pursue it further without more education. I heard about the Flatiron School through an initiative in my hometown that partnered with them, and I decided that taking a course in Software Engineering with them felt like a better path, so I applied, and was accepted.

So, here I am. A mathematician-turned-programmer, hoping to learn a lot, solve problems, and have a lot of fun, and now, into my third week in the course, it's looking like all of those objectives are being met.
